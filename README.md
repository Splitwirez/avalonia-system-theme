# Avalonia System Look & Feel

Experimental effort to bring platform-specific theming into Avalonia. (This isn't a fork of Avalonia, just an addon library. No changes are needed to Avalonia's styling system to make this happen.)

Currently, a small handful of controls are supported, and support only exists on Windows with Visual Styles enabled and Linux via GTK.



Contributions are welcome.
